# Abstract
The increase in the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions is an emerging global health concern. Studies of the impact on the lives of individuals living with GI conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) typically focus on biological elements, such as symptomology and treatment efficacy. Comparatively fewer studies have explored the psychological and social aspects of GI conditions, which could provide key information needed to better understand the impact of GI conditions on people and their lived experiences. In this review, existing literature concerning the psychosocial factors and well-being outcomes associated with GI conditions was reviewed using a scoping methodology. Sixty-eight studies were selected for inclusion. Of these studies, the well-being outcomes most frequently addressed, for both IBS and IBD, were quality of life and health-related quality of life, and the most frequently addressed psychosocial factors were social support and coping. These outcomes are largely consistent with those identified for other medical conditions explored using the biopsychosocial model of health, with some exploration of the lived experiences of those with a GI condition.
