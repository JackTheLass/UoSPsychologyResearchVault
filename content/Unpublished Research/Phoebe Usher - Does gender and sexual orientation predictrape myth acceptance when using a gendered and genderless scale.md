#### Abstract
Rape myths are false beliefs about the stereotypical causes of rape, the perpetuators of rape and who can be a victim of rape. Rape myth acceptance is a holistic belief within a culture that often supports and perpetuates sexual violence. The increase of rape myth acceptance can cause men and women to not report a rape and normalise the act of sexual assault and rape causing increased crime. 

The present study examines the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance scale (IRMA) which used gendered pronouns and an adapted scale (GRMA) which used gender-neutral pronouns, to see if this would influence rape myth acceptance. The impact of the participants gender and sexual identity was also considered. 147 participants took part in the study, 32 males and 115 females, by answering both of the questionnaires and rating each statement on a likert scale. The order of the questions was randomised in both questionnaires. Results revealed that overall participants scored higher in rape myth acceptance in the IRMA scale than in the GRMA scale. Results also indicated that men scored higher in rape myth acceptance in both scales compared to women. These findings indicate that the GRMA scale is more inclusive and relatable for participants as this scale does not conform to gender stereotypes. It also supports previous research that also observed that men endorse rape myths more than women. This study also adds to the under researched aspect of the use of gender-neutral pronouns and their impact on rape myth acceptance. Unexpected findings, possible future directions and limitations are discussed, particularly LGBTQ+ men’s endorsement of rape myths and the use of this scale as a predictor and preventor of sexual violence.
