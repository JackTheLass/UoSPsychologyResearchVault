Despite my field of research focussing on sexual violence, specifically victims, even more specifically sex workers!
- I'm also interested in research on developmental psychology, particularly how different upbringings and environments can shape children as they develop.
- I'm also interested in the psychology of pornography, particularly the complex issues around CNC (consent non consent).
- Finally, I'm also interested in the relationship between Aphantasia (not being able to visualise images in your mind) and Schizophrenia, as this was one of my other research ideas for my PhD.
