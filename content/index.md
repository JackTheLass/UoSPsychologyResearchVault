# Getting Started

1. This is a shared space, so make sure when you're sharing your research/interests, make sure you're creating a ==**new note**==. To do this **==click on the button shown below==** **==or press Ctrl + N / Cmd + N==**, this should be in the top left corner.

# After Adding Your Notes

After you've added your notes, you **==MUST==** sync this with everyone else, this is how to do it:

Before doing this you may need to **=="pull" changes==** that other people have made!

First click the **=="Fetch origin"==** button at the top of your GitHub Desktop:

# Tips & Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks to add a little more life to your notes!

**Bold:** To make a part of your text bold, you can either add two ** before and after your piece of text OR you can highlight a piece of text you would like bold and press Ctrl + B or Cmd + B.

*Italics:* To made a part of your text italicised, you can either add one * before and after your piece of text OR you can highlight a piece of text you would like italicised and press Ctrl + I or Cmd + I.

# Titles
If you would like to add titles to your text, type in a hashtag, then add a space and start adding your title. The less hashtags you have, the bigger your title will be, the more hashtags you have, the smaller your title will be. For example,
# Title
## Title
### Title
#### Title

==Highlighting:== To highlight your text, you can add two == before and after your piece of text you would like to highlight.
